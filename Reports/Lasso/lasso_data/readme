this dir contains two problems 

1: a data set with p=50 samples in n=100 dimensions. training data
are (x,y) from data1_input_train (x) and data1_output_train (y).
validation data are in (xv,yv) from data1_input_val (xv) and
data1_output_val (yv).

2: a matlab file correlated_data.m to generate samples from the
problem with correlated data discussed on slide 23 with w=[2,3,0]
and w=[-2,3,0].
